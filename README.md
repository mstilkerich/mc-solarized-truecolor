# Solarized skins for midnight commander in ANSI/256-color/truecolor variants

This skin is based on denius/mc-solarized-skin, which uses ANSI colors and requires a customized ANSI color palette in
the terminal configuration.

Nowadays, pretty much all terminal emulators support 256-color modes, and even truecolor (16 million colors) is getting
commonly available.

This repository provides solarized skin variants with color definitions from the 256-color palette as well as truecolor
definitions. The upside is that with these skins, you will not have to setup a custom terminal color palette. The 256
color variant is just an approximation as the color palette does not contain the actual colors used by solarized.
